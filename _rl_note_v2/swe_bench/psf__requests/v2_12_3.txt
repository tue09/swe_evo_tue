2.12.3 (2016-12-01)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with
    "http". These URLs have historically been processed as though they
    were HTTP-schemed URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was
    removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems
    with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This change was reverted: the other
    fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return
    to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.
