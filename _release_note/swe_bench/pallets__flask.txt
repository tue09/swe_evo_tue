Version 2.3.0
-------------

Released 2023-04-25

-   Drop support for Python 3.7. :pr:`5072`
-   Update minimum requirements to the latest versions: Werkzeug>=2.3.0, Jinja2>3.1.2,
    itsdangerous>=2.1.2, click>=8.1.3.
-   Remove previously deprecated code. :pr:`4995`

    -   The ``push`` and ``pop`` methods of the deprecated ``_app_ctx_stack`` and
        ``_request_ctx_stack`` objects are removed. ``top`` still exists to give
        extensions more time to update, but it will be removed.
    -   The ``FLASK_ENV`` environment variable, ``ENV`` config key, and ``app.env``
        property are removed.
    -   The ``session_cookie_name``, ``send_file_max_age_default``, ``use_x_sendfile``,
        ``propagate_exceptions``, and ``templates_auto_reload`` properties on ``app``
        are removed.
    -   The ``JSON_AS_ASCII``, ``JSON_SORT_KEYS``, ``JSONIFY_MIMETYPE``, and
        ``JSONIFY_PRETTYPRINT_REGULAR`` config keys are removed.
    -   The ``app.before_first_request`` and ``bp.before_app_first_request`` decorators
        are removed.
    -   ``json_encoder`` and ``json_decoder`` attributes on app and blueprint, and the
        corresponding ``json.JSONEncoder`` and ``JSONDecoder`` classes, are removed.
    -   The ``json.htmlsafe_dumps`` and ``htmlsafe_dump`` functions are removed.
    -   Calling setup methods on blueprints after registration is an error instead of a
        warning. :pr:`4997`

-   Importing ``escape`` and ``Markup`` from ``flask`` is deprecated. Import them
    directly from ``markupsafe`` instead. :pr:`4996`
-   The ``app.got_first_request`` property is deprecated. :pr:`4997`
-   The ``locked_cached_property`` decorator is deprecated. Use a lock inside the
    decorated function if locking is needed. :issue:`4993`
-   Signals are always available. ``blinker>=1.6.2`` is a required dependency. The
    ``signals_available`` attribute is deprecated. :issue:`5056`
-   Signals support ``async`` subscriber functions. :pr:`5049`
-   Remove uses of locks that could cause requests to block each other very briefly.
    :issue:`4993`
-   Use modern packaging metadata with ``pyproject.toml`` instead of ``setup.cfg``.
    :pr:`4947`
-   Ensure subdomains are applied with nested blueprints. :issue:`4834`
-   ``config.from_file`` can use ``text=False`` to indicate that the parser wants a
    binary file instead. :issue:`4989`
-   If a blueprint is created with an empty name it raises a ``ValueError``.
    :issue:`5010`
-   ``SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`` does not fall back to ``SERVER_NAME``. The default is not
    to set the domain, which modern browsers interpret as an exact match rather than
    a subdomain match. Warnings about ``localhost`` and IP addresses are also removed.
    :issue:`5051`
-   The ``routes`` command shows each rule's ``subdomain`` or ``host`` when domain
    matching is in use. :issue:`5004`
-   Use postponed evaluation of annotations. :pr:`5071`
