2.31.0 (2023-05-22)
-------------------

**Security**
- Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential
  forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when
  following HTTPS redirects.

  When proxies are defined with user info (https://user:pass@proxy:8080), Requests
  will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to
  authenticate with the proxy.

  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached
  the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being
  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on
  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade
  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy
  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.

  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through
  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this
  vulnerability.
